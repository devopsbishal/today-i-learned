# Today I Learned

A personal learning journal where I document what I learn each day. Writing things down helps me understand concepts better and gives me a reference to look back on when I need a refresher.

## 📚 What's This?

This is my collection of bite-sized learnings - concepts, insights, and "aha moments" I pick up along the way. Each entry is written in my own words, often with real-world analogies that help me remember.
