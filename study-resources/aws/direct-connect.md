# AWS Direct Connect -- 2-Hour Study Plan

**Total Time:** ~120 minutes
**Created:** 2026-02-24
**Difficulty:** Intermediate-Advanced

## Overview

This study plan covers AWS Direct Connect end-to-end: the physical connection types (Dedicated vs Hosted), the three virtual interface types (Private VIF, Public VIF, Transit VIF) and when to use each, Direct Connect Gateway for multi-VPC and multi-region access, Link Aggregation Groups for combining connections, BGP routing policies and communities that control traffic flow, and the three resiliency models (development/test, high resiliency, maximum resiliency) that determine your SLA. After completing it, you will be able to design a hybrid connectivity architecture that integrates Direct Connect with the Transit Gateway topology you built yesterday, explain the trade-offs between Direct Connect and Site-to-Site VPN, and select the right resiliency model for a given workload criticality. This plan assumes you already understand VPC route tables, Transit Gateway association/propagation mechanics, and TGW attachment types from the past week.

## Resources

### 1. What Is AWS Direct Connect? -- Official User Guide ⏱️ 15 min
- **URL:** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html
- **Type:** Official Docs
- **Summary:** The foundational reference that establishes what Direct Connect is and how its components fit together. Covers the two connection types (Dedicated at 1/10/100 Gbps vs Hosted at 50 Mbps-10 Gbps through APN Partners), the three virtual interface types (Private, Public, Transit) at a high level, the physical network requirements (single-mode fiber, 802.1Q VLAN encapsulation, BGP with MD5 authentication, optional BFD), and the pricing model (port hours plus outbound data transfer). The key mental model to build here is that Direct Connect is a Layer 1-3 solution: you get a physical fiber cross-connect at a colocation facility, then layer logical virtual interfaces on top to reach different AWS destinations. Read this first to establish the vocabulary and component relationships before diving into specifics.

### 2. Direct Connect Virtual Interfaces -- Official User Guide ⏱️ 20 min
- **URL:** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithVirtualInterfaces.html
- **Type:** Official Docs
- **Summary:** The detailed reference for Private VIF, Public VIF, and Transit VIF -- the three logical channels you create on top of a physical Direct Connect connection. Private VIF connects to a single VPC (via Virtual Private Gateway) or multiple VPCs (via Direct Connect Gateway), supports jumbo frames at 9001 bytes MTU, and is the traditional way to reach private resources. Public VIF connects to all AWS public services (S3, DynamoDB endpoints, etc.) using public IP addresses you own, with BGP community tags controlling which regions see your advertised prefixes. Transit VIF connects to Transit Gateway through a Direct Connect Gateway, enabling access to thousands of VPCs across regions through a single BGP session -- this is the option that ties directly into yesterday's Transit Gateway architecture. Key constraint: a Hosted connection supports only one VIF, while a Dedicated connection supports up to 50 VIFs (private/transit) or 1 public VIF. Also covers VLAN tagging (802.1Q), BGP peer IP address allocation, and the SiteLink feature that enables site-to-site traffic between Direct Connect locations without traversing an AWS Region.

### 3. Direct Connect Gateways -- Official User Guide ⏱️ 15 min
- **URL:** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/direct-connect-gateways-intro.html
- **Type:** Official Docs
- **Summary:** The reference for Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW), the globally available resource that solves the multi-VPC and multi-region connectivity problem. Without DXGW, each Private VIF can only reach one VGW in one region -- so connecting 10 VPCs across 3 regions would require 10 separate VIFs. With DXGW, a single Private VIF reaches up to 20 VPCs (via VGW associations) globally, and a single Transit VIF reaches up to 6 Transit Gateways (which each connect to thousands of VPCs). Critical limitation: DXGW handles north-south traffic only (on-prem to AWS) -- it does not enable VPC-to-VPC east-west traffic. If two VPCs are associated with the same DXGW, they cannot communicate through it unless a supernet is advertised that covers both VPC CIDRs (which is generally an anti-pattern). This is why Transit Gateway remains essential for east-west traffic. Also covers cross-account association proposals, where the DXGW owner accepts or rejects requests from other accounts to associate their VGWs or TGWs.

### 4. Direct Connect in Multi-VPC Infrastructure -- AWS Whitepaper ⏱️ 25 min
- **URL:** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/direct-connect.html
- **Type:** Official Docs (Whitepaper)
- **Summary:** The architecture decision guide that presents six options for using Direct Connect in a multi-VPC environment, building from simplest to most scalable. Option 1: Private VIF directly to VGW (one VIF per VPC, simplest but does not scale). Option 2: Private VIF to DXGW to multiple VGWs (up to 20 VPCs globally, one BGP session, but no VPC-to-VPC transit). Option 3: Transit VIF to DXGW to Transit Gateway (the recommended default -- connects to up to 6 TGWs serving thousands of VPCs, single BGP peering, but limited to 200 prefixes from TGW to on-prem and incurs TGW data processing at $0.02/GB). Option 4: Public VIF plus VPN to TGW (adds encryption over Direct Connect). Option 5: Private IP VPN over Transit VIF (IPsec without public IPs). Option 6: GRE tunnels for SD-WAN integration. The whitepaper recommends a blended approach -- Transit VIF as default for most traffic, with Private VIF for edge cases where high-volume data transfer to specific VPCs would make TGW processing charges prohibitive. Also covers MACsec encryption for 10/100 Gbps connections, SiteLink for inter-site connectivity via the AWS backbone, and the recommended minimum of 2 connections at 2 different DX locations (4 total) for production resiliency.

### 5. Direct Connect Routing Policies and BGP Communities -- Official User Guide ⏱️ 15 min
- **URL:** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/routing-and-bgp.html
- **Type:** Official Docs
- **Summary:** The reference for how BGP routing works specifically in the context of Direct Connect, which differs meaningfully from standard BGP because AWS controls one side of the peering session. Covers the route evaluation order: local preference BGP communities are evaluated first, then AS_PATH length, then MED (lowest priority). For Private/Transit VIFs, three local preference communities control active/passive failover: 7224:7100 (low), 7224:7200 (medium, default for same-region), 7224:7300 (high) -- tag your primary connection with 7300 and backup with 7100 for deterministic failover. For Public VIFs, scope communities control prefix propagation: 7224:9100 (local region only), 7224:9200 (continental), 7224:9300 (global). All routes are tagged with NO_EXPORT to prevent AWS routes from leaking to the broader internet. ECMP is supported across multiple VIFs when prefixes have identical AS_PATH length and attributes, which is how you achieve active/active load balancing across redundant connections. Also covers the AWS-side ASN (7224) and the distinction between public and private ASNs on the customer side.

### 6. AWS Direct Connect Resiliency Toolkit -- Official User Guide ⏱️ 15 min
- **URL:** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/resiliency_toolkit.html
- **Type:** Official Docs
- **Summary:** The reference for the three resiliency models that determine your Direct Connect SLA and architecture. Maximum Resiliency (99.99% SLA): separate connections on separate devices at multiple DX locations, protecting against device failure, fiber cuts, and complete location outages -- this is the architecture for mission-critical production workloads. High Resiliency (99.9% SLA): two single connections at multiple locations, protecting against fiber cuts and device failures but with less redundancy than maximum. Development and Test (no SLA): two connections on separate devices at a single location, protecting only against device failure -- a complete location failure takes you offline. The toolkit includes a connection wizard that automatically prevents connections from terminating on the same device, creates LAGs when needed, and provides failover testing so you can verify traffic reroutes correctly before a real outage. The failover testing capability is critical: it lets you bring down a BGP session on demand to confirm your active/passive or active/active configuration actually works as designed.

### 7. Direct Connect with Transit Gateway -- AWS Hybrid Connectivity Whitepaper ⏱️ 15 min
- **URL:** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/hybrid-connectivity/aws-dx-dxgw-with-aws-transit-gateway-multi-regions-and-aws-public-peering.html
- **Type:** Official Docs (Whitepaper)
- **Summary:** Ties together everything from the previous resources by showing the complete reference architecture: dual Direct Connect connections from a single data center to two independent DX locations, both connected through a DXGW to Transit Gateways in multiple AWS regions, with a Public VIF for accessing AWS public services like S3. This is the architecture you studied from the TGW side yesterday (the DX Gateway attachment was one of the five attachment types) -- today you see it from the Direct Connect side. Key details: one Transit VIF per DX connection connects to one DXGW, that DXGW associates with up to 6 TGWs across regions, and each TGW connects to thousands of VPCs via the hub-and-spoke model you already understand. The 200-prefix limit from TGW to on-premises (via DXGW) means you need route summarization -- you cannot advertise individual /24 subnets for 500 VPCs. Also covers Transit Gateway cross-region peering as the mechanism for inter-region VPC traffic, which complements the Direct Connect path for hybrid connectivity.

## Study Tips

- **Draw the full hybrid architecture stack as you read.** Start at the bottom with your on-premises router, draw the fiber cross-connect to the DX location, add VIFs (Private, Transit, Public) as logical channels on that physical connection, connect them through DXGW to VGWs and Transit Gateways, and finally connect TGWs to your spoke VPCs. Label each component with its quota limits (50 VIFs per Dedicated connection, 20 VGWs per DXGW, 6 TGWs per DXGW, 200 prefixes from TGW to on-prem). This single diagram will be your interview reference for any hybrid connectivity question.

- **Map the VIF type selection to your existing Transit Gateway knowledge.** Private VIF to VGW is the equivalent of a point-to-point VPC peering connection (simple, no transit). Transit VIF to DXGW to TGW is the equivalent of Transit Gateway hub-and-spoke (scalable, transitive). Public VIF is a separate channel entirely. If you can explain this mapping in an interview, you demonstrate deep understanding of how the networking layers compose.

- **Internalize the cost decision framework.** Direct Connect has two cost components: port hours (fixed) and data transfer out (per-GB, cheaper than internet). Transit VIF adds TGW data processing ($0.02/GB) on top. For a VPC receiving 10 TB/month from on-prem, Private VIF to VGW costs just DX transfer fees, while Transit VIF adds ~$200/month in TGW processing. This is why the whitepaper recommends a blended approach: Transit VIF for most VPCs (simplicity) plus Private VIF for high-bandwidth VPCs (cost savings).

## Next Steps

After completing this study plan, consider exploring:

1. **Site-to-Site VPN (Day 5, tomorrow)** -- The complementary hybrid connectivity option. VPN provides encrypted tunnels over the internet at up to 1.25 Gbps per tunnel, with ECMP support on Transit Gateway for aggregated bandwidth. The key design pattern is Direct Connect as primary path with VPN as encrypted backup -- use BGP communities (7224:7300 on DX, 7224:7100 on VPN) for deterministic failover.

2. **Route53 Hybrid DNS (Week 3, Day 2)** -- The missing piece for hybrid architectures: how on-premises servers resolve AWS private hosted zone records and how VPC instances resolve on-prem DNS names. Direct Connect provides the network path, but Route53 Resolver Inbound/Outbound endpoints provide the DNS resolution. Without this, your hybrid connectivity is IP-only with no name resolution.

3. **Multi-account landing zone project (Week 7)** -- The architecture where everything converges: Transit Gateway in a network services account, Direct Connect connections terminating at that account's DXGW, shared via RAM to spoke accounts, with centralized egress and inspection VPCs. The patterns from this week's DX + TGW study are the networking foundation for that project.

4. **Hands-on with the Resiliency Toolkit** -- While you cannot provision real Direct Connect connections without a colocation facility, you can explore the connection wizard in the AWS console to see how the three resiliency models translate to connection orders, LAG configurations, and failover testing options.
